# Treasure2! Relics integration datapack
Adds a new loot table with all items from the Relics mod,
and replaces some loot tables from Treasure2! to include relics !
Also replaces rarity weights for each treasure rarity
(in other words, changes how often a Mythical rarity chest appears
in the world)

Relics are made part of Treasure2!'s combat loot tables,
as well as inside skull, golden skull, and crystal skull chests.
Guaranteed to find a relic inside a mythical chest.

Infinity Ham is not part of the Relics loot table that I created
(I find this item really overpowered). You can add an entry 
inside `data/relics/loot_tables/items.json` if you want it to be part of it. All relics have the same weight.

For default loot table values, please check them out on the Treasure2's mod repository
(at `src/main/resources/data/treasure2/`)
